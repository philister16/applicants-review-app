## Reviewing Applicants

For each applicant, you'll see:

- **Rating options** (1-5 stars)
- **Comments field** for your notes (300 character maximum)

### Navigation

- The **progress bar** at the top shows how many applicants you've reviewed
- Your ratings and comments are **automatically saved** as you work

### Tips for Efficient Review

- Rate each applicant immediately after reviewing their information
- Use the comments field to note specific strengths or concerns
- The application works offline - no internet connection required
- Your ratings are stored in your browser, so don't clear your browser data until you've exported

## Exporting Your Ratings

2. Click the **"Export Ratings to CSV"** button

3. A file named `EC_applications_rated_by_[Your Name].csv` will be downloaded to your computer

## Troubleshooting
